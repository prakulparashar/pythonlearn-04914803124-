Python for Data Analytics:

Welcome to my repository! This project serves as a live tracker of my progress as I learn Python and its powerful ecosystem for data science. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world data application.

# Tech Stack

I am currently focusing on the "Big Three" libraries for data manipulation and visualization:

->NumPy: For high-performance numerical computing and array manipulation.

->Pandas: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

->Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

# Learning Objectives

->Data Wrangling: Transforming raw, messy data into clean, actionable datasets.

->Statistical Analysis: Understanding data distributions and key metrics.

->Data Visualization: Building intuitive charts (histograms, scatter plots, etc.) to uncover hidden patterns.

->Real-World Application: Applying these skills to actual datasets to solve practical problems.

# Roadmap

-> Python Fundamentals

-> NumPy Basics & Vectorization

-> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas

-> Advanced Visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn
